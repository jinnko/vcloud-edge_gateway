## 0.6.0 (UNRELEASED)

Features:

  - `vcloud-edge-configure --version` now only returns the version string
    and no usage information.
  - A side effect of changes to the executable means that exceptions from
    Vcloud::EdgeGateway and Vcloud::Core will now result in a stacktrace
    being returned by the CLI, which we'll retain for now until we refine
    the error messages.

Bugfixes:

    - The `vcloud-configure-edge` command has been renamed to `vcloud-edge-configure`.

## 0.5.0 (2014-05-15)

Bugfixes:

  - Don't set a load balancer healthcheck URI for healthchecks using protocols other than HTTP

## 0.4.0 (2014-05-12)

Features:

  - Allow config files to be rendered from [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)
    templates so that common configs can be re-used across environments with
    differences represented as variables.

## 0.3.0 (2014-05-01)

Features:

  - Depend on version 0.2.0 of vcloud-core which introduces breaking changes to namespacing

## 0.2.4 (2014-05-01)

  - Use pessimistic version dependency for vcloud-core

## 0.2.3 (2014-04-22)

Bugfixes:

  - Requires vCloud Core v0.0.12 which fixes issue with progress bar falling over when progress is not returned

Features:

  - Now uses the config loader and validator in vcloud-core rather than its own duplicate.
  - Require fog v1.21 to allow use of FOG_VCLOUD_TOKEN via ENV as an alternative to a .fog file
